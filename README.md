# wifinetworkspecifierconnect

A Flutter plugin which uses wifi network specifier for *Android Q*. 
For android less than *Q* it uses *wifimanager* to connect to wifi.

This plugin just support connecting to a particular wifi on android and that's it.
I will work on iOS integration later.

You can get connected or not connected state as *true* or *false*.
